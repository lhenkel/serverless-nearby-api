I had a project that would show all the customers for the company I worked at that were nearby.  So I have a React client that gets the lat/long and sends it to this.

Unfortunately I couldn't show it to anyone since it had customer data.  So I made this and used Starbucks locations instead.  All the names/emails/order data is fake.   If you add the queue, it'll really add, but nobody will do anything about it (have a ball).

I started with this https://gitlab.com/jbesw/askjames-caffeinate-me but re-wrote to use Lambda functions, Cognito and SQS.

I'll post the client code hopefully soon.
